                    An e-commerce clothing brand was facing significant
                    operational strain due to a high volume of inbound customer
                    inquiries. The support team was spending hours every day on
                    repetitive tasks, leading to several key business
                    challenges:

                    <li>
                      <strong>Slow Response Times:</strong> Customers often
                      waited 24-48 hours for an initial reply, especially
                      outside of business hours, leading to frustration.

                      <strong>Inconsistent Answers:</strong> Different team
                      members provided slightly different answers to common
                      questions about returns or shipping.

                    <li>

                      department, causing further delays.

                    <li>
                      <strong>No Centralized History:</strong> Customer
                      interaction history was scattered across various email
                      threads, making it impossible to get a full picture of a
                      customer's journey.

                    <p>
                      We chose Typeform as the initial trigger point for several
                      strategic reasons. It provides a superior user experience
                      for the customer compared to a standard web form, and most
                      importantly, it delivers clean, structured data to the
                      automation. This pre-structured data (e.g., a dedicated
                      email field) is crucial for minimizing errors and
                      simplifying the downstream AI processing.

                      This automation is highly adaptable. While it currently
                      uses Typeform, it can easily be configured to trigger from
                      other common customer interaction points, including: A
                      Dedicated Email Inbox, Live Website Chat, or a Direct API
